Because OpenAI has a limit on the input prompt size, we would like to send the data to be summarized in parts. 
There can be multiple ways to split the text. For the sake of simplicity, we will divide the whole book on the basis of pages. 
A **better strategy** will be to split it on the basis of paragraphs. However, it will increase the number of API calls increasing the overall time.

We will store each page in a list and then summarize it.
