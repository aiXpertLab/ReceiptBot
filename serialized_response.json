"The information extracted from the receipt image is structured into a JSON format as specified:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"receipt_headers\": {\n    \"store_name\": \"Trader Joe's\",\n    \"slogan\": \"\",\n    \"address\": \"100 Front Street Santa Cruz, CA 95060\",\n    \"store_manager\": \"\",\n    \"phone_number\": \"831-425-0140\",\n    \"transaction_id\": \"****6000\",\n    \"date\": \"\",\n    \"time\": \"\",\n    \"cashier\": \"\",\n    \"subtotal\": 9.98,\n    \"sales_tax\": 0,\n    \"total\": 9.98,\n    \"gift_card\": 0,\n    \"charged_amount\": 9.98,\n    \"card_type\": \"MasterCard\",\n    \"auth_code\": \"N64K4H\",\n    \"chip_read\": \"\",\n    \"aid\": \"\",\n    \"issuer\": \"\",\n    \"policy_id\": \"\",\n    \"expiration_date\": \"\",\n    \"survey_message\": \"\",\n    \"survey_website\": \"\",\n    \"user_id\": \"\",\n    \"password\": \"\",\n    \"eligibility_note\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"line_items\": [\n    {\n      \"sku\": \"\",\n      \"description\": \"WRAP ORG SOUTHWEST CHICK\",\n      \"details\": \"\",\n      \"price\": 5.39\n    },\n    {\n      \"sku\": \"\",\n      \"description\": \"CUT FRUITFUL MEDLEY 16 O\",\n      \"details\": \"\",\n      \"price\": 3.99\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote:\n- Fields such as the \"slogan\", \"store_manager\", \"date\", \"time\", \"cashier\", \"sales tax\", \"chip_read\", \"aid\", \"issuer\", \"policy_id\", \"expiration_date\", \"survey_message\", \"survey_website\", \"user_id\", \"password\", and \"eligibility_note\" were not available or not applicable from the data provided in the receipt and are thus left empty or set to default values.\n- The SKU for each item is not listed on the receipt, so these entries remain empty.\n- The payment details include truncation of the transaction ID for security, and similar truncation is applied for some parts of the payment card number.\n- The address is inferred to include city and state based on the typical formatting found on receipts, despite them not being distinctly separated in the text."
